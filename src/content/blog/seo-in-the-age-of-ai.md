# SEO in the Age of AI: What Actually Works for Small Businesses

Search didn't die — **it evolved**. In the last year, Google rolled out AI Overviews (the AI summary you sometimes see at the top of results), tightened spam policies, and clarified what "helpful content" means. For small businesses, the winners aren't the sites that crank out the most words; it's the ones that **answer real questions with real expertise** in formats Google can trust and reuse.

## What changed (and why it matters)

**AI Overviews.** For many queries, Google now shows an AI-generated summary that cites sources. You don't "opt in." You **earn inclusion** by publishing clear, trustworthy, well-structured answers that show first-hand experience and are easy for Google to parse.

**Core & spam updates.** Google has cracked down on scaled, low-value content, "parasite SEO" (third-party content on strong domains), and expired-domain abuse. Mass-produced fluff is riskier than ever. Depth, originality, and usefulness win.

**Quality signals.** Guidance keeps pointing to the same north star — **help people first**. That means experience (have you actually done this?), expertise (are you qualified?), authority (do others cite you?), and trust (clear sourcing, policies, and transparent branding).

## A practical playbook for 2025

### 1) Publish "answer-ready" content

Write to be quoted. Break answers into scannable chunks with clear headings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists. Include a **one-paragraph answer** near the top, then go deeper. Use specifics: measurements, steps, before-and-after photos, checklists, and local context. Generic advice won't cut it — **information gain** does.

*Pro tip:* Add a short *"How we do this on real jobs"* section. First-hand experience is hard to fake and extremely useful to customers.

### 2) Show real-world experience (E-E-A-T)

Add an author line with credentials, a photo, and a 1–2 sentence bio. For service content, include on-site photos, the tools you use, and safety notes you actually follow. Link to an **About** page and **Policies** page (warranty, refunds, estimates). These build trust for readers and quality raters.

### 3) Use structured data (schema)

Add schema for **Organization**, **LocalBusiness**, **FAQ**, **HowTo**, **Product/Service**, and **Article** where relevant. Schema won't guarantee AI Overview placement, but it **helps Google understand context** and unlocks richer features (FAQ toggles, how-to steps, pricing). Keep it accurate and consistent with the visible page.

### 4) Target problems, not just keywords

Think like your buyer:

- "Slab sank after winter — can it be lifted or replaced?"
- "Website for a contractor — what pages do I need?"
- "How much does concrete leveling save vs. replacement?"

Structure pages around those intents, not just head terms. Use **FAQ sections** for the follow-ups you actually hear on the phone.

### 5) Refresh and consolidate

Stale pages get ignored. Quarterly, update pricing examples, photos, and service areas. Merge thin pages that overlap into one strong hub and 301 the rest. If a post no longer serves a purpose, unpublish it.

### 6) Build authority with proofs

- Publish **case studies** with location, scope, and outcomes.
- Add brief **quotes or testimonials** (with permission).
- Share **data** from your jobs (avg. lift, time on site, cost range).
- Earn natural mentions: local chambers, suppliers, partners, podcasts, and community sites.

### 7) Speed, UX, and basics still matter

Fast, mobile-friendly pages with clear headings, readable fonts, and no intrusive pop-ups perform better. Make CTAs obvious and repeated: a **top-of-page button**, **mid-page text link**, and **end-of-page banner**.

### 8) Measure what matters

In Search Console, track:

- Queries with impressions but low clicks → improve titles/meta and add a "tl;dr" answer box.
- Pages with frequent **FAQ** impressions → expand those sections.
- Location queries → tighten **LocalBusiness** details and service-area copy.

## Your next three moves

1) **Pick one "money" question** (e.g., *Concrete leveling vs. replacement: cost, timeline, durability*).

2) Write a **900–1200 word** answer with a summary box, an FAQ, one mini case study, and a single "Get a Quote" CTA.

3) Add/update schema (FAQ + Article + LocalBusiness), publish, and monitor in Search Console for 2–4 weeks.
